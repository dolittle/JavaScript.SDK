# [17.0.1] - 2021-7-23 [PR: #58](https://github.com/dolittle/JavaScript.SDK/pull/58)
## Summary

Adding "sdk.embeddings" to the "sdk" package.json.

### Fixed

- Adding sdk.embeddings to sdk, making the npm package include the new embeddings work


# [17.0.0] - 2021-7-20 [PR: #55](https://github.com/dolittle/JavaScript.SDK/pull/55)
## Summary

Renames the `compare` and `remove` builder methods and decorators to `resolveUpdateToEvents` and `resolveDeletionToEvents`, so that the API is consistent with the C# SDK. The new names also are more descriptive of their new function.

Also updated the JS sample code to match the new [embeddings tutorial](https://dolittle.io/docs/tutorials/embeddings/).

### Added
- A new exception `CouldNotResolveUpdateToEvents`, which can be used as the default exception for when the `resolveUpdateToEvents` couldn't resolve into any events
- A new exception `CouldNotResolveDeletionToEvents`, which can be used as the default exception for when the `resolveUpdateToEvents` couldn't resolve into any events

### Changed
- `compare` method and decorator became `resolveUpdateToEvents`
- `remove` method and decorator became `resolveDeletionToEvents`
- `resolveUpdateToEvents` and `resolveDeletionToEvents` now has to return an `Object | Object[]` instead of `any | any[]`. This is to enforce the methods always returning one or many events


# [16.0.0] - 2021-7-1 [PR: #54](https://github.com/dolittle/JavaScript.SDK/pull/54)
## Summary

Renames the call to delete an embedding from`embeddings.delete()` to `embeddings.remove()`, so that it's consistent with the `@remove()` decorator and inline builder naming.

Originally the decorators were also supposed to be called `@delete()`, but as `delete` is a reserved keyword in JS, we changed them to `@remove()`, but didn't think of changing the deletion call too to match. Internally the processor and contracts still call it `delete`, this change only affects the outside facing API.

### Changed

- Change the `embeddings.delete()` call to `embeddings.remove()`.


# [15.0.0] - 2021-6-29 [PR: #47](https://github.com/dolittle/JavaScript.SDK/pull/47)
## Summary

Adds a new feature, Embeddings! They are similar to Projections, but they are meant to be used to event source changes coming from an external system. Check the [sample](https://github.com/dolittle/JavaScript.SDK/tree/master/Samples/Tutorials/Embeddings) for an example.

Also changes the behavior of the pinging system to be more reliable and to be ready to receive pings immediately upon connecting to the Runtime. This is to deal with a bug that was causing connections between the SDK and the Runtime to be dropped. This is a **breaking behavioral change** and it's related to the [release of version `v6`](https://github.com/dolittle/Runtime/pull/532) of the Runtime. You have to update to version `v6*` of the Runtime, older versions wont work with this release of the SDK. We've added a [compatibility table](https://dolittle.io/docs/reference/runtime/compatibility) for checking the supported versions.

### Added

- Embeddings! You can use them inline with the `withEmbeddings()` method, or with the `@embedding`, `@compare`, `@delete` and `@on` decorators on classes. The embeddings can be updated, deleted and fetched from the `client.embeddings` property.

### Changed

- The reverse call connections are now ready to start receiving pings and writing pongs immediately upon connecting.

### Fixed

- Fix Event Horizon connection to actually retry if it encounters an error in the connection process.
- Pinging system should now timeout a lot less than before.


# [14.4.0] - 2021-5-19 [PR: #52](https://github.com/dolittle/JavaScript.SDK/pull/52)
## Summary

Adds the current `ExecutionContext` as an argument to `IContainer.get(...)` and sends it along from the `EventContext` when instantiating event handler classes.

### Added

- Added `executionContext: ExecutionContext` as an argument in `IContainer.get(...)`.


# [14.3.2] - 2021-5-18 [PR: #50](https://github.com/dolittle/JavaScript.SDK/pull/50)
## Summary

Fixes `applyPublic()` to actually be public. It was giving false for the `isPublic` parameter for the committing of the event.

### Fixed

- Fixes `applyPublic()` to actually commit public events.


# [14.3.1] - 2021-4-23 [PR: #49](https://github.com/dolittle/JavaScript.SDK/pull/49)
## Summary

Changes all `interface` types to `abstract class`. Their naming stays the same, as we're still using them like interfaces. 
The reason for the change is to enable the use of dependency-injection frameworks for TS/JS for developers.
Transpiling TS -> JS strips away all the interfaces, leaving the DI framework with no token to associate with the type.
Changing them to abstract classes generates empty classes (that must not be instantiated in JS), that can be used as binding tokens.

### Changed

- All `interfaces` to `abstract class`.


# [14.3.0] - 2021-4-9 [PR: #44](https://github.com/dolittle/JavaScript.SDK/pull/44)
## Summary

Adds Projections, that are a special type of event handler dealing with read models. Projections can be defined either inline in the client build steps, or declaratively with `@projection()` decorator.

Example for writing inline projections and registering declared projections:
```typescript
const client = Client
    .forMicroservice('f39b1f61-d360-4675-b859-53c05c87c0e6')
    .withEventTypes(eventTypes => {
        eventTypes.register(DishPrepared);
        eventTypes.register(ChefFired);
    })
    .withProjections(projections => {
        projections.createProjection('4a4c5b13-d4dd-4665-a9df-27b8e9b2054c')
            .forReadModel(Chef)
            .on(DishPrepared, _ => _.keyFromProperty('Chef'), (chef, event, ctx) => {
                console.log(`Handling read model ${JSON.stringify(chef)}`);
                chef.name = event.Chef;
                chef.dishes.push(event.Dish);
                return chef;
            })
            .on(ChefFired, _ => _.keyFromProperty('Chef'), (chef, event, ctx) => {
                console.log(`Firing ${chef.name}`);
                return ProjectionResult.delete;
            });
        projections.register(Menu);
    })
    .build();
```

Example of `@projection()` decorator:
```typescript
@projection('5b22e60e-f8db-494e-af5c-e8728acb2470')
export class Menu {
    dishes: string[] = [];

    @on(DishPrepared, _ => _.keyFromEventSource())
    on(event: DishPrepared, ctx: EventContext) {
        if (!this.dishes.includes(event.Dish)) {
            this.dishes.push(event.Dish);
        }
    }
}
```

Example of getting projections:
```typescript
const {state: menu} = await client.projections
	.forTenant(TenantId.development)
	.get(Menu, 'bfe6f6e4-ada2-4344-8a3b-65a3e1fe16e9');
console.log('Got menu', menu);

console.log('Getting all chefs');
for (const [, { key, state: chef }] of await client.projections.forTenant(TenantId.development).getAll(Chef)) {
    console.log(`Found chef ${key}`, chef);
}
console.log('Getting all chefs but specify ids');
for (const [, { key, state: chef }] of await client.projections.forTenant(TenantId.development).getAll(Chef, '4a4c5b13-d4dd-4665-a9df-27b8e9b2054d')) {
    console.log(`Found chef ${key}`, chef);
}
console.log('Getting all chefs with no type');
for (const [, { key, state: chef }] of await client.projections.forTenant(TenantId.development).getAll('4a4c5b13-d4dd-4665-a9df-27b8e9b2054c', ScopeId.default)) {
    console.log(`Found chef ${key}`, chef);
}
```

### Added
- New `client.withProjections()` to build Projections inline in the clients build steps.
- Classes can be decorated with`@projection('projectionId')` to declare them as Projections (just like you can do with EventHandlers). The class itself becomes the readmodel for the projection.
- `on()` methods are the handlers for a Projection. They `@on()` decorator defines the event for the method to handle and it defines the key to use for the read model.
- Get the state of a Projection with `client.projections.get<ReadModel>(key)` and `client.projections.getAll<ReadModel>()` (+ other overloads).
- Sample for how to use Projections in _Samples/Tutorials/Projections_.

### Changed
- Sample directory structure and moved the tutorials around

### Fixed
- Fix references in _tsconfig.json_ files
